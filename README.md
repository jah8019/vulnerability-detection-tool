# Vulnerability Detection Tool

## Overview

The Vulnerability Detection Tool is a comprehensive solution designed to identify and manage code vulnerabilities in your projects. This tool consists of two main components:
1. A **CLI Tool** that can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated vulnerability scanning.
2. A **Visual Studio Code Extension** that provides real-time vulnerability detection within the editor.

## Features

- Detects common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and Buffer Overflow.
- Provides detailed reports including file paths, line numbers, and descriptions of vulnerabilities.
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code security throughout the development lifecycle.
- Real-time scanning in Visual Studio Code to catch vulnerabilities early in the development process.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-detection-tool.git
cd vulnerability-detection-tool
npm install
```
### CLI Usage

The CLI tool allows you to scan files for vulnerabilities directly from the command line. This is particularly useful for integrating into CI/CD pipelines.

Build the CLI Tool

```bash
npm run build:cli
```
Run the CLI Tool
```bash
npm run vuln-scan -- /path/to/your/code/file
```

Replace /path/to/your/code/file with the actual path of the file you want to scan.

Example
```bash
npm run vuln-scan -- ./TestData/BufferOverflow.cs
```
### Visual Studio Code Extension

The VSCode extension provides real-time vulnerability detection within the editor, helping you catch issues early in the development process.

Build the Extension
```bash
npm run build:extension
```
Running the Extension

Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
Press F5 to open a new VSCode window with the extension loaded.
Open any file and the extension will automatically scan for vulnerabilities.

Commands

Check for Vulnerabilities: You can manually trigger a vulnerability scan by running the command Check for Vulnerabilities from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
npm run test
```
