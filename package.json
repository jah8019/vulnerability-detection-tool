  "description": "OverviewThe Vulnerability Detection Tool is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to identify and report security-related coding errors within your source code. This tool helps developers detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process, thus reducing the risk of security breaches and enhancing overall code quality.FeaturesReal-time Vulnerability Detection: The extension analyzes your source code as you type, highlighting potential security issues instantly.Support for Multiple Languages: Initially supports Python and JavaScript, with the possibility to extend support to other programming languages.Detailed Error Reporting: Provides detailed descriptions of detected vulnerabilities, including their potential impact and suggestions for remediation.Customizable Rulesets: Allows users to configure and customize rulesets to fit specific project needs.Integration with VS Code: Seamlessly integrates with the VS Code interface, offering a smooth and intuitive user experience.Supported Vulnerability TypesThe tool focuses on detecting the following common security vulnerabilities:SQL Injection:Detects potential SQL injection points in your code where user input is directly used in SQL queries.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):Identifies locations in your code where unsanitized user input is incorporated into web pages, which could lead to XSS attacks.Buffer Overflow:Recognizes code patterns that could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, ensuring your code is safe from such attacks.How It WorksThe extension uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing and pattern matching to analyze your source code for known vulnerability patterns. When a potential issue is detected, it highlights the problematic code segment and provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, along with suggestions for mitigation.InstallationOpen Visual Studio Code.Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.Search for \"Vulnerability Detection Tool\".Click Install to install the extension.Reload Visual Studio Code to activate the extension.UsageOpen a project or file in VS Code.The extension will automatically analyze the code in real-time as you type or modify the code.Vulnerabilities will be highlighted in the editor, and detailed information will be displayed in the Problems panel.CustomizationTo customize the rulesets:Go to the settings by clicking on the gear icon in the lower left corner and selecting Settings.Search for \"Vulnerability Detection Tool\" settings.Modify the rulesets and other settings according to your project needs.ContributionContributions are welcome!
